## About ChatCRS

ChatCRS is a project developed to provide both Congress and the public with a research tool while demonstrating the immense potential of open government data when paired with large language models (LLMs).

The initial version includes:
- Comprehensive Search: Search through over 10,000 CRS reports dating from 2013 to present to find relevant documents.
- Chatbot Query Interface: Select a report and interact with it via a chatbot using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o API.
- Adjustable Query Creativity: Adjust the "temperature" to control how much the chatbot relies on CRS reports versus external information.
- Formatted Content Generation: Produce formatted documents like policy memos or constituent letters using the information gathered.

## The Importance of EveryCRSreport.com
This project builds on the pioneering work of everyCRSreport.com, a site developed through the efforts of Daniel Schuman, Demand Progress, and the Congressional Data Coalition. The site makes CRS reports publicly available, expanding on the work of earlier civic hackers like Josh Ruihley (opencrs.com), Antoine McGrath (crsreports.com), and the Federation of American Scientists. Congress later expanded access through CRS.congress.gov, but everyCRSreport.com remains the most comprehensive and organized source of CRS reports.

This project would not have been possible without the dedicated work of advocates like Daniel Schuman and the technical foundation at everyCRSreport.com. In the spirit of open government data, POPVOX Foundation is open sourcing the ChatCRS code on GitHub and sharing metadata on Hugging Face for collaborative development.
